        collect your data, or monetize your attention.

        and user control — without compromise.

      <h2>Our Technology Approach</h2>

      <p>
        Echo Technology builds its browsers on carefully selected
        Chromium-based foundations, choosing the right balance
        between compatibility, performance, and privacy.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Surf Browser</strong> is available in two editions:
        one based on <strong>Vanilla Chromium</strong>,
        focused on broad compatibility and stability,
        and another based on <strong>Ungoogled Chromium</strong>,
        designed for users who prefer a fully de-Googled,
        privacy-first experience.
      </p>

      <p>
        Both editions are optimized for reduced background activity,
        minimal resource usage, and transparent behavior,
        without added telemetry, advertising frameworks,
        or hidden online services.
      </p>

      <p>
        We believe modern users face different challenges online.
        That is why Echo focuses on flexible, purpose-driven builds,
        rather than a one-size-fits-all solution.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
        * Chromium and Ungoogled Chromium are independent
        open-source projects used as technical foundations.
        Echo Technology does not modify or control upstream
        Chromium development and focuses on transparent
        configuration, distribution, and user experience.
      </p>

  <!-- Search -->
  <section class="partners">
      <h2>Default Search in Surf Browser</h2>

      <p>
          Search is a core part of everyday browsing.
          That is why Surf Browser uses a privacy-respecting
          search engine by default.
      </p>

      <p>
          <strong>Surf Browser</strong> uses <strong>Presearch</strong>
          as its default search engine.
      </p>

      <p class="search-powered">
          Private search powered by <strong>Presearch</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
          Presearch is a decentralized search platform
          focused on privacy and transparency.
          It does not track users, build personal profiles,
          or sell behavioral data.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
          Presearch is a third-party search provider.
          Echo Technology is an independent project
          and is not owned or operated by Presearch.
