        We build privacy-focused browsers that do not track your behavior,
        collect your data, or monetize your attention.
      </p>

      <p>
        Echo Technology stands for transparency, simplicity,
        and user control — without compromise.

  <!-- Mission -->
 <section class="mission">
  <h2>Our Mission</h2>

  <p>
    To create software that respects people —
    not treats them as products.
  </p>

  <p>
    A clean, fast, and honest web experience,
    even on older or low-power hardware.
  </p>
</section>


  <!-- Technology -->
  <section class="foundation">
  <h2>Our Technology Approach</h2>

  <p>
    Echo Technology builds Surf Browser on top of
    <strong>ungoogled-chromium</strong> —
    an open-source Chromium base without Google services.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our focus is not on deep source-level patching,
    but on careful configuration, sane defaults,
    and predictable browser behavior.
  </p>

  <p>
    Surf Browser is optimized for reduced background activity,
    lower resource usage, and strong compatibility
    with modern websites — without added telemetry,
    advertising frameworks, or hidden online services.
  </p>

  <p>
    We believe privacy should be practical.
    That is why Surf Browser avoids extreme changes
    that break websites or user workflows.
  </p>

  <p class="note">
    * Chromium and ungoogled-chromium are independent
    open-source projects used as technical foundations.
    Echo Technology does not control upstream development
    and focuses on transparent configuration,
    distribution, and user experience.
  </p>
</section>


  <!-- Search -->
  <section class="partners">
  <h2>Default Search in Surf Browser</h2>

  <p>
    Search is a core part of everyday browsing.
    That is why Surf Browser uses a privacy-respecting
    search engine by default.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Surf Browser</strong> uses <strong>Presearch</strong>
    as its default search engine.
  </p>

  <p class="search-powered">
    Private search powered by <strong>Presearch</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    Presearch is a decentralized search platform
    focused on privacy and transparency.
    It does not build personal profiles
    or sell behavioral data.
  </p>

  <p class="note">
    Presearch is a third-party service.
    Echo Technology is an independent project
    and is not owned or operated by Presearch.
