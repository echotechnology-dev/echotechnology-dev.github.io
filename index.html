        We build privacy-focused browsers that do not track your behavior,
        collect your data, or monetize your attention.
      </p>

      <p>
        Echo Technology stands for transparency, simplicity,
        and user control — without compromise.

      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        To create products that respect people — not treat them as products.
        Tools built to empower users, not to exploit them.
      </p>
      <p>
        A web experience that feels clean, fast,
        and honest — even on older hardware.

      <h2>Our Technology Approach</h2>

      <p>
        Echo Technology builds its browsers on carefully selected
        Chromium-based projects, choosing the right foundation
        for each specific use case.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Surf Browser</strong> is available in two editions:
        one based on <strong>Chromium builds from Woolyss</strong>
        for maximum compatibility, and another based on
        <strong>Ungoogled Chromium</strong> for users who prefer
        a fully de-Googled experience.
      </p>

      <p>
        Both approaches prioritize performance, transparency,
        and reduced background activity — without adding telemetry
        or hidden services.
      </p>

      <p>
        We believe modern users face different challenges online.
        That is why Echo focuses on flexible, purpose-driven builds,
        rather than a one-size-fits-all solution.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
        * Chromium and Ungoogled Chromium are third-party projects
        currently used as a technical base.
        Echo Technology aims to move toward fully independent
        Chromium foundations over time, as technical feasibility
        and resources allow.
      </p>

  <!-- Search -->
  <section class="partners">
      <h2>Default Search in Surf Browser</h2>

      <p>
          Search is a core part of everyday browsing.
          That is why Surf Browser uses a privacy-respecting
          search engine by default.
      </p>

      <p>
          <strong>Surf Browser</strong> uses <strong>Presearch</strong>
          as its default search engine.
      </p>

      <p class="search-powered">
          Private search powered by <strong>Presearch</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
          Presearch is a decentralized search platform
          focused on privacy and transparency.
          It does not track users, build personal profiles,
          or sell behavioral data.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
          Presearch is a third-party search provider.
          Echo Technology is an independent project
          and is not owned or operated by Presearch.
