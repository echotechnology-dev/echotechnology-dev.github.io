        We build privacy-focused browsers that do not track your behavior,
        collect your data, or monetize your attention.

      <p>
        Echo Technology stands for transparency, simplicity,
        and user control — without compromise.

  <!-- Mission -->
  <section class="mission">
      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        To create browsers that respect people — not treat them as products.
        Tools built to empower users, not to exploit them.
      </p>
      <p>
        A web experience that feels clean, fast,
        and honest — even on older hardware.
      </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Foundation -->
  <section class="foundation">
      <h2>Our Technology Approach</h2>
      <p>
Echo Technology builds its browsers on carefully selected Chromium-based projects,
choosing the right foundation for each use case.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Surf Browser</strong> uses <strong>Presearch</strong>
    as the default search engine.
</p>

<p class="search-powered">
    Private search powered by <strong>Presearch</strong>
</p>

<p>
    Presearch is a decentralized, privacy-focused search platform
    that does not track users or build personal profiles.
</p>

<p class="note">
* Chromium and Ungoogled Chromium are third-party projects currently used as a technical base.
Echo Technology aims to move toward fully independent Chromium foundations over time,
as technical feasibility and resources allow.
</p>

 <!-- Partnerships -->
<section class="partners">
    <h2>Search & Partnerships</h2>

    <p>
        Echo Technology carefully selects third-party services
        that align with our core values of privacy, transparency,
        and user respect.

        <strong>Surf Browser</strong> uses <strong>Presearch</strong>

        This choice reflects our commitment to providing
        a clean and honest browsing experience —
        without hidden monetization or behavioral profiling.
    </p>

    <p class="note">
        Presearch is a third-party search provider.
        Echo Technology is an independent project
        and is not owned or operated by Presearch.
