    <h1>Why I Build Software</h1>
    <p>
      My name is Max — an independent, self-taught developer.
      I never planned to build a browser until I began to better understand
      how modern browsers operate behind the scenes,
      and how much control users often lack by default.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Story -->
  <section>
    <h2>How It Started</h2>
    <p>
      As I explored browser telemetry, background services,
      and default configurations,
      it became clear that many modern browsers
      are no longer simple or neutral tools —
      both technically and ethically.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found it increasingly difficult to accept a web
      where privacy is optional,
      performance is secondary,
      and users are treated primarily as data sources.
      That realization became the starting point for Echo.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Why Echo -->
  <section>
    <h2>Why I Build Echo</h2>
    <p>
      Echo is developed independently.
      It is not backed by investors,
      advertising models,
      or data-driven incentives.
    </p>
    <p>
      I build Echo because I believe software can be honest.
      Tools should serve people —
      not advertisers,
      not data brokers,
      and not hidden interests.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- What Echo Represents -->
  <section>
    <h2>What Echo Represents</h2>

    <p><strong>Echo is not just a product. It is a position.</strong></p>

    <p>
      Echo is a response to a digital ecosystem
      where surveillance has become normalized
      and complexity often obscures real browser behavior.
    </p>

    <p>
      The goal is to prove that browsers can respect users
      while remaining fast, lightweight, and usable —
      even on older or low-end hardware.
    </p>

    <p>
      Autonomy, transparency, and respect for the individual
      are not abstract ideals here —
      they are practical design requirements.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Vision & Direction -->
  <section>
    <h2>Vision & Direction</h2>

    <p>
      The long-term vision behind Echo Technology
      is a browser built on a deeply independent foundation,
      offering stronger guarantees around privacy,
      security, and internal behavior
      than configuration alone can provide.
    </p>

    <p>
      Building and maintaining such a platform
      requires significant time, infrastructure,
      and technical resources.
      For now, Echo focuses on practical products
      that solve real problems for users today.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Surf Browser</strong> is one of those products —
      designed to improve performance,
      reduce unnecessary background activity,
      and enhance privacy within realistic technical limits.
    </p>

    <p>
      These projects are not compromises.
      They are deliberate steps that provide experience,
      feedback, and a solid foundation for the future.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Goal -->
  <section>
    <h2>My Goal</h2>
    <p>
      To create software that prioritizes performance,
      minimizes unnecessary background activity,
      and reduces tracking wherever possible —
      without requiring expensive hardware
      or advanced technical knowledge.
    </p>

    <p>
      Privacy and security should be accessible,
      not reserved for powerful devices
      or expert users only.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Future -->
  <section>
    <h2>Where This Is Going</h2>
    <p>
      Surf Browser is only the beginning.
      More tools will follow —
      not to dominate the market,
      but to demonstrate that ethical,
      lightweight,
      and transparent alternatives can exist.
      Simpler. Lighter. More human.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Outro -->
  <section class="cta">
    <blockquote>
      “Privacy is not about hiding.
      It’s about choosing who you trust.”
    </blockquote>

    <p class="cta-text">
      If you value privacy, simplicity,
      and honest software —
      you’re welcome here.
