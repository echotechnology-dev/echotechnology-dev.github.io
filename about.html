      <h1>Why I Build Browsers</h1>
      <p>
        My name is Max — an independent, self-taught developer.
        I never planned to build a browser until I began to understand
        how much personal data modern browsers collect —
        often without transparency or meaningful consent.
      </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Story -->
  <section>
      <h2>How It Started</h2>
      <p>
        The deeper I looked into browser telemetry — especially inside Google Chrome —
        the clearer it became that modern browsers are no longer neutral tools.
        Not only technically, but ethically.
      </p>
      <p>
        I refused to accept a web where privacy is a luxury
        and users are treated as exploitable datasets.
        That decision became the starting point for Echo.
      </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Why Echo -->
  <section>
      <h2>Why I Build Echo</h2>
      <p>
        I do not work for corporations or investors.
        Echo has no ads, no crypto incentives,
        and no participation in the surveillance economy.
      </p>
      <p>
        I build Echo because I believe software can be honest.
        Tools should serve people — not advertisers.
      </p>
  </section>

  <!-- What Echo Represents -->
  <section>
      <h2>What Echo Represents</h2>

      <p><strong>Echo is not a product. It is a position.</strong></p>

      <p>
        Echo is a principled response to a digital ecosystem
        where surveillance has become normalized
        and data extraction is treated as standard practice.
      </p>

      <p>
        Echo proves that browsers can respect users
        without sacrificing performance or usability.
        No ads. No tracking. No background services.
      </p>

      <p>
        Autonomy, transparency and respect for the individual
        are not ideals here — they are requirements.
      </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Goal -->
  <section>
      <h2>My Goal</h2>
      <p>
        To create browsers that respect users, avoid tracking,
        collect nothing, do not sell behavior,
        and remain fast even on older or low-power hardware.
      </p>
      <p>
        Privacy should not depend on expensive devices
        or technical expertise.
      </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Future -->
  <section>
      <h2>Where This Is Going</h2>
      <p>
        Surf is only the beginning.
        More tools will follow — not to dominate the market,
        but to prove that ethical alternatives exist.
        Simpler. Lighter. More human.
      </p>
  </section>

        If you value privacy, simplicity and honest software —
        you’re welcome here.
