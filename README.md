# Echo Technology

Echo Technology is an independent project focused on building
lightweight, privacy-respecting software with transparent behavior
and practical performance.

We believe browsers should serve users —
not monetize them or operate behind hidden incentives.

## Projects

### Surf Browser
A lightweight browser built on **ungoogled-chromium**, designed for:
- reduced background activity
- no Google services or telemetry
- strong compatibility with modern websites
- good performance on low-end and older hardware

Surf Browser is the current actively developed and released product.

### Echo Browser
A long-term flagship vision focused on deeper browser independence
and stronger internal guarantees around privacy and behavior.

Development of Echo Browser is currently paused while the project
focuses on practical, user-ready products.

## Philosophy
- No ads, no tracking, no user profiling
- Transparency over hidden behavior
- Performance without requiring modern hardware
- Privacy without breaking the web

## Website

## Status
Surf Browser **v1.0** is publicly released and available for download.

Echo Technology is developed independently,
