      <h1>Why I Build Browsers</h1>
      <p>
        My name is Max — an independent, self-taught developer.
        I never planned to build a browser until I began to understand
        how much personal data modern browsers can collect —
        often without clear transparency or meaningful user choice.
      </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Story -->
  <section>
      <h2>How It Started</h2>
      <p>
        The deeper I explored browser telemetry and background services —
        especially in mainstream browsers —
        the clearer it became that modern browsers are no longer neutral tools.
        Not only technically, but ethically.
      </p>
      <p>
        I could not accept a web where privacy becomes optional,
        performance is sacrificed for monetization,
        and users are treated primarily as data sources.
        That realization became the starting point for Echo.
      </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Why Echo -->
  <section>
      <h2>Why I Build Echo</h2>
      <p>
        I do not work for corporations or investors.
        Echo is developed independently,
        without advertising models, crypto incentives,
        or participation in the surveillance economy.
      </p>
      <p>
        I build Echo because I believe software can be honest.
        Tools should serve people — not advertisers,
        not data brokers, and not hidden incentives.
      </p>

  <!-- What Echo Represents -->
  <section>
      <h2>What Echo Represents</h2>

      <p><strong>Echo is not just a product. It is a position.</strong></p>

      <p>
        Echo is a response to a digital ecosystem
        where surveillance has become normalized
        and complexity often hides real browser behavior.
      </p>

      <p>
        Echo aims to prove that browsers can respect users
        while remaining fast, lightweight, and usable —
        even on older or low-end hardware.
      </p>

      <p>
        Autonomy, transparency, and respect for the individual
        are not ideals here — they are design requirements.
      </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Flagship & Direction -->
  <section>
      <h2>Flagship Vision & Direction</h2>

      <p>
        The original flagship vision of Echo Technology is a browser
        built on a fully independent and complete Chromium foundation.
        This level of control is essential to achieve deeper guarantees
        around privacy, security, and internal browser behavior —
        beyond what configuration and patches alone can provide.
      </p>

      <p>
        Developing and maintaining such a browser requires
        significant technical resources, infrastructure, and time.
        For this reason, development of the flagship Echo Browser
        is currently frozen.
      </p>

      <p>
        This does not mark the end of the vision.
        Instead, Echo is currently focused on practical products
        that solve real problems for users today.
        <strong>Surf Browser</strong> is one such project —
        designed to improve performance, reduce unnecessary background activity,
        and enhance privacy within realistic technical limits.
      </p>

      <p>
        These products are not compromises.
        They are stepping stones that provide experience,
        feedback, and a foundation for the long-term goal.
      </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Goal -->
  <section>
      <h2>My Goal</h2>
      <p>
        To create browsers that prioritize performance,
        minimize unnecessary background activity,
        and reduce tracking wherever possible —
        without requiring expensive hardware
        or advanced technical expertise.
      </p>
      <p>
        Privacy and security should be accessible,
        not reserved for powerful devices
        or experienced users only.
      </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Future -->
  <section>
      <h2>Where This Is Going</h2>
      <p>
        Surf is only the beginning.
        More tools will follow — not to dominate the market,
        but to demonstrate that ethical, lightweight,
        and transparent alternatives can exist.
        Simpler. Lighter. More human.
      </p>

        If you value privacy, simplicity, and honest software —
        you’re welcome here.
